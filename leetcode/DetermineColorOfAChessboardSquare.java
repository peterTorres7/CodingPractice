/**

    You are given coordinates, a string that represents the coordinates of a square of the chessboard. 
    Below is a chessboard for your reference.

    Return true if the square is white, and false if the square is black.

    The coordinate will always represent a valid chessboard square. 
    The coordinate will always have the letter first, and the number second.
    

    Example 1:

    Input: coordinates = "a1"
    Output: false
    Explanation: From the chessboard above, the square with coordinates "a1" is black, so return false.
