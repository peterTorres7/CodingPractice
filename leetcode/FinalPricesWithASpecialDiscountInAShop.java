/**

    You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop.

    There is a special discount for items in the shop. If you buy the ith item, 
    then you will receive a discount equivalent to 
    prices[j] where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i]. 
    Otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

    Return an integer array answer where answer[i] is the final price you will pay for the ith item of the shop, 
    considering the special discount.
    

    Example 1:

    Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
    Output: [4,2,4,2,3]
