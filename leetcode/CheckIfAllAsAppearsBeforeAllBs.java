/**

    Given a string s consisting of only the characters 'a' and 'b', 
    return true if every 'a' appears before every 'b' in the string. Otherwise, return false.
    

    Example 1:

    Input: s = "aaabbb"
    Output: true
    Explanation:
    The 'a's are at indices 0, 1, and 2, while the 'b's are at indices 3, 4, and 5.
    Hence, every 'a' appears before every 'b' and we return true.
