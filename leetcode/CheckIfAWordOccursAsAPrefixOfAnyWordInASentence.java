/**

    Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a searchWord, 
    check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.

    Return the index of the word in sentence (1-indexed) where searchWord is a prefix of this word. 
    If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (minimum index). 
    If there is no such word return -1.

    A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.
    

    Example 1:

    Input: sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"
    Output: 4
