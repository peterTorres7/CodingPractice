/**

    Given a string s and a character letter, 
    return the percentage of characters in s that equal letter rounded down to the nearest whole percent.
    

    Example 1:

    Input: s = "foobar", letter = "o"
    Output: 33
    Explanation:
    The percentage of characters in s that equal the letter 'o' is 2 / 6 * 100% = 33% when rounded down, 
    so we return 33.
