/**

    Given two integer arrays startTime and endTime and given an integer queryTime.

    The ith student started doing their homework at the time startTime[i] and finished it at time endTime[i].

    Return the number of students doing their homework at time queryTime. More formally, 
    return the number of students where queryTime lays in the interval [startTime[i], endTime[i]] inclusive.
    

    Example 1:

    Input: startTime = [1,2,3], endTime = [3,2,7], queryTime = 4
    Output: 1
