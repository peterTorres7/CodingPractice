/**
    Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

    Return the answer in an array.

    

    Example 1:

    Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
    Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
