/**

    You are given a string s formed by digits and '#'. 
    We want to map s to English lowercase characters as follows:

        Characters ('a' to 'i') are represented by ('1' to '9') respectively.
        Characters ('j' to 'z') are represented by ('10#' to '26#') respectively.

    Return the string formed after mapping.

    The test cases are generated so that a unique mapping will always exist.


    Example 1:

    Input: s = "10#11#12"
    Output: "jkab"

public class DecryptStringFromAlphabetToIntegerMapping {
    
    // Time: O()
    // decrypt string from alphabet to integer mapping



    // main
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    }
}
