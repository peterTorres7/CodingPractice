/**

    You are given a non-negative integer array nums. In one operation, you must:

        Choose a positive integer x such that x is less than or equal to the smallest non-zero element in nums.
        Subtract x from every positive element in nums.

    Return the minimum number of operations to make every element in nums equal to 0.

    
    Example 1:

    Input: nums = [1,5,0,3,5]
    Output: 3
