/**

    You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and a target element target.

    A target index is an index i such that nums[i] == target.

    Return a list of the target indices of nums after sorting nums in non-decreasing order. 
    If there are no target indices, return an empty list. 
    The returned list must be sorted in increasing order.
    

    Example 1:

    Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 2
    Output: [1,2]
    Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5].
    The indices where nums[i] == 2 are 1 and 2.
