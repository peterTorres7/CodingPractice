/**

    You are given two integer arrays of equal length target and arr. 
    In one step, you can select any non-empty subarray of arr and reverse it. 
    You are allowed to make any number of steps.

    Return true if you can make arr equal to target or false otherwise.

    

    Example 1:

    Input: target = [1,2,3,4], arr = [2,4,1,3]
    Output: true
