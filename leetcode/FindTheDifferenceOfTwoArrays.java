/**

    Given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return a list answer of size 2 where:

        answer[0] is a list of all distinct integers in nums1 which are not present in nums2.
        answer[1] is a list of all distinct integers in nums2 which are not present in nums1.

    Note that the integers in the lists may be returned in any order.

    

    Example 1:

    Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4,6]
    Output: [[1,3],[4,6]]
